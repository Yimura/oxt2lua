# Oxt2Lua

This script will convert oxt files to a lua script that can be for FiveM servers.

## What does it do?

For single player GTA V mods there are language files that tell the engine which items should be named in a certain way.
This tool parses such files and converts them to a drop in lua script.


There's an example oxt file to test it yourself.


The tool will output `vehicle_name.lua` file, you can rename it to anything want.
